# llama-conversational-model

This Python script demonstrates the integration of a large-scale conversational model using the Llama-2-13B model from Hugging Face. It leverages GPU acceleration through llama-cpp-python for efficient inference. The script initializes the model, processes a user prompt, and generates a helpful response using fine-tuned parameters such as max_tokens, temperature, and top_k. This setup enables interactive deployment, potentially through platforms like Streamlit, allowing users to engage with the model via a web interface.
